If a VSTO add-in refuses to load on a workstation, the following will
make the system display the full error message instead of just saying
that it was not able to load.

set the environment variable:

VSTO_SUPPRESSDISPLAYALERTS to the value 0 and it will display the message

First troubleshooting tip. Set the environment variable VSTO_SUPPRESSDISPLAYALERTS to 0. I just use the Advanced tab in the System Properties dialog so the environment variable is machine wide.
